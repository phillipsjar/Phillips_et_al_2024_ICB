# Code and data for all analyses referenced by Phillips et al. (2024) - The effects of habitat and respiratory strategy on hypoxia performance in anuran tadpoles. Integrative Comparative Biology.


# The following code performs a series of linear and logistic regressions to test the effects of hypoxia, lung presence/absence, habitat type, and a derived continous temperature value on tadpole # responsiveness, air-breathing rates, climbing behaviors, and surfacing behaviors. See the following manuscript for full context and feel free to contact the corresponding author
